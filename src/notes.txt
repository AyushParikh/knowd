Neural Search:
Neural search refers to the use of neural networks, particularly deep learning models, 
to enhance the search process. It involves leveraging neural network architectures such 
as transformers to improve various aspects of search, including query understanding, 
document ranking, and relevance matching. Neural search models often rely on dense vector 
representations (embeddings) to encode the meaning of queries and documents in a high-dimensional 
space. By utilizing neural networks, neural search aims to capture complex relationships 
and patterns within the data for more accurate and context-aware search results.

Semantic Search:
Semantic search, on the other hand, focuses on understanding the meaning of queries and 
documents by interpreting their semantic context. It aims to provide search results that
are not solely based on keyword matching but rather on the understanding of the intent 
and context behind the query. Semantic search techniques utilize natural language processing 
(NLP) methods, including syntactic analysis, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, 
and semantic parsing, to extract the semantics of text. By understanding the relationships 
between words and phrases, semantic search systems can identify relevant documents based on 
the meaning and context rather than just literal keyword matching.
